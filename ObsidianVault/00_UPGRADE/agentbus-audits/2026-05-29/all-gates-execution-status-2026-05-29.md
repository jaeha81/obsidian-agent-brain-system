# All Gates Execution Status - 2026-05-29

## Scope

Execution status after the user approved proceeding with all remaining gates.

## Completed

### Sniper Push / Deploy Gate

- Repo: `D:\ai프로젝트\sniper-buying-dashboard`
- Pre-push build: `npm.cmd run build` passed.
- Pushed local `master` to `origin/master`.
- First pushed commit: `f5b6147f523420d415cae9a8917f069b4f1e9ba8`
- Later external/local work added:
  - `1aaaf4b fix: orders/[id] route에 누락된 admin-auth 헬퍼 적용`
  - `377ca9f feat: wire admin data pages to Supabase APIs`
- Final local HEAD after push: `377ca9f0477cfd16c919a0b4454a275f059929b4`
- Final remote `origin/master` after push: `377ca9f0477cfd16c919a0b4454a275f059929b4`
- Live root URL: HTTP 200
- Live products URL: HTTP 200

### Discord Supervisor / Voice Runtime Gate

- `.env` changed locally:
  - `VOICE_ENABLED=true`
  - `VOICE_CHANNEL_ENABLED=true`
  - `VOICE_RECV_ENABLED=true`
  - `BOT_ALLOWED_HOSTNAME=P0517A-22H2T8`
  - `TESSERACT_CMD=C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`
- Fixed supervisor stdout/stderr handle lifetime.
- Added Discord bot safe-print fallback for closed stdout.
- Restarted bot through supervisor.
- Current supervisor process observed.
- Current child bot process observed.
- PID file matches current child bot PID.
- Bot log shows:
  - `Bot ready`
  - Whisper STT ON
  - TTS ON
  - realtime voice receive ON

### External Blockers

- Tesseract installed through winget.
- Tesseract executable verified:
  - `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`
  - version `5.4.0.20240606`
- `pytesseract.get_tesseract_version()` passed with `TESSERACT_CMD`.
- OpenAI model-list auth check: HTTP 200.
- Anthropic model-list auth check: HTTP 200.

### Obsidian Dirty Handling

- Committed and pushed runtime code fixes:
  - commit `07f0196 fix: stabilize Bucky bot supervisor voice runtime`
- Reverted local UI/runtime noise:
  - `.obsidian/graph.json`
  - `ObsidianVault/00_System/BUCKY_STATUS.md`
- Deleted empty scaffold note:
  - `Untitled Kanban.md`
- Final Obsidian git status: clean after push.

## Still Not Fully Proved

### Discord Voice End-to-End

The bot is running with voice features enabled, but full voice-channel E2E is not proven.

Reason:

- Discord guild channel listing returned HTTP 403, so Codex could not discover a voice channel ID.
- No `AUTO_JOIN_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID` was set.
- No user voice phrase was sent during this run.

Required final proof:

1. User joins a voice channel.
2. User sends `!join` in Discord.
3. User speaks one short phrase.
4. User checks Bucky response.
5. User sends `!leave`.

### Gemini

Gemini Python module exists, but no `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` was present.

Required final proof:

- Add a Gemini/Google API key if Gemini is still required.
- Run a Gemini auth check.

## Verification

- Obsidian tests: 20 passed.
- Python compile passed for modified Discord runtime files.
- Sniper build passed.
- Sniper final build passed after the admin data pages/API commit.
- Tesseract executable and Python wrapper verified.

## Current Decision

All actions that Codex can execute with the available credentials and local state are complete.

Remaining proof depends on:

- Discord voice-channel/user interaction.
- Optional Gemini key provisioning.

## Recheck 2026-05-29 06:59 KST

- Obsidian git status: clean (`master...origin/master`).
- Obsidian verification:
  - `python -m py_compile scripts\discord_bot.py scripts\bucky_bot_supervisor.py scripts\discord_vision_processor.py` passed.
  - `python -m unittest discover -s tests` passed: 20 tests.
- Discord runtime:
  - Supervisor process observed.
  - Child bot process observed.
  - PID file contains child bot PID.
  - Latest runtime log shows `Bot ready`, Whisper STT ON, TTS ON, realtime voice receive ON.
  - No new `*voice*` inbox files were present after restart.
  - Latest inbox records were text Discord intake records, not voice-channel E2E proof.
- External auth:
  - OpenAI model-list check returned HTTP 200 using process environment.
  - Anthropic model-list check returned HTTP 200 using `.env`.
  - Gemini/Google key remains absent.
- Sniper:
  - Repo status clean.
  - Local HEAD remains `377ca9f0477cfd16c919a0b4454a275f059929b4`.
  - Live root and `/products` returned HTTP 200.

Current conclusion unchanged: Codex-executable gates are complete; remaining proof still requires user Discord voice interaction and optional Gemini key provisioning.

## Recheck 2026-05-29 07:14 KST

- Obsidian repo:
  - `git fetch origin master` completed.
  - Local HEAD and `origin/master` both point to `5dc0de634e0460e2707754368d17ef7704759a46`.
  - `git status --short --branch --untracked-files=all` is clean.
  - `python -m py_compile scripts\discord_bot.py scripts\bucky_bot_supervisor.py scripts\discord_vision_processor.py` passed.
  - `python -m unittest discover -s tests` passed: 20 tests.
- Discord runtime:
  - Supervisor and child `discord_bot.py` process observed.
  - Voice flags are configured in `.env`.
  - No `AUTO_JOIN_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID` or `AUTO_JOIN_TEXT_CHANNEL_ID` is configured.
  - No new `*voice*` inbox files were found.
  - Latest inbox records are text Discord intake records, not voice E2E proof.
- Gemini:
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY` absent in `.env` and process environment.
  - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` absent in `.env` and process environment.
- Sniper:
  - Local repo contained two unpushed commits after the prior handoff:
    - `26154c7 fix: products/[id] 잔존 인증 취약점 제거 (Codex P1/P2)`
    - `cdd3d72 fix: .env.local.example에 ADMIN_PASSWORD 복원`
  - `npm.cmd run build` passed.
  - Secret keyword scan of the net diff found no secret value.
  - `origin/master` now points to `cdd3d728d84f2dd1ee227ff659b5baae07812943`.
  - Live root and `/products` returned HTTP 200.
  - Live auth probe with legacy `admin_session=authenticated` cookie returned HTTP 401 for both `PUT /api/products/__codex_auth_probe__` and `DELETE /api/products/__codex_auth_probe__`.

Current conclusion: Sniper drift is resolved. Remaining proof still depends on user Discord voice-channel interaction and optional Gemini key provisioning.
